        <div class="details__overview">
          <p>I know what you're thinking... Whaaat?! 10 programming languages in one course? 30 apps?</p>
          <p>Yep, you're right, 10 programming languages, 30 apps.</p>
          <br />
          <p>The focus of this course is to teach you how to code, not how to master a language.</p>
          <p>Instead you're going to learn all about variables, scopes, methods and functions, parameters/arguments, classes, loops, objects, data types and more!</p>
          <br />
          <p>You will learn how to think like a programmer, how to code real apps and most important, you will become a programmer with solid understanding of what's going on under the hood.</p>
          <br />
          <p>I've been in your place, and the reality is, it's hard to learn how to code, and how to do it well.</p>
          <p>The programming world is full of languages, tools, frameworks and libraries, and it's difficult to find where to start.</p>
          <br />
          <p>That's why I created this course, to teach people like you how to code from the very beginning, from A to Z. Stop fidgeting through the noise, I'll teach you everything from HTML and CSS up to how to configure servers and deployment.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Are you ready to become a programmer?</p>
