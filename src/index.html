          <p><b>I know what you're thinking...🔮</b><br />Whaaat?! 10 programming languages and 30 apps in one course?<br />Yep, you're right, 10 programming languages, 30 apps.</p>
          <p>The focus of this course is to teach you how to code, not how to master a language.</p>
          <p>You will learn how to think like a programmer, how to code real apps, and most important, you'll become a programmer with solid understanding of what's going on under the hood.</p>
          <p>The programming world is full of languages, tools, frameworks and libraries, and believe me, it's difficult to find where and how to start.</p>
          <p>That's why I created this course, to teach people like you how to code from the very beginning, from A to Z, and how to do it well.</p>
          <p>Stop fidgeting through the noise, I'll teach you everything from HTML and CSS up to how to configure servers and deployment.</p>
          <p>Are you ready to become a programmer? 😉</p>
